# LinkedIn Post: Universal Public Data MCP Server

🚀 **Just shipped: Universal Public Data MCP Server - Your Gateway to 20+ Real APIs!**

After weeks of development, I'm excited to share my latest open-source project: a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that unifies access to financial, news, weather, GitHub, scientific, and government data through a single interface.

## 🎯 **What makes this special?**

✅ **6 Data Categories, 20+ Tools**: From Yahoo Finance to NASA APIs  
✅ **100% Real Data**: No mocks - live API integrations with proper error handling  
✅ **Production-Ready**: Caching, rate limiting, async operations, comprehensive docs  
✅ **Learning-Focused**: 4 interactive Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step tutorials  

## 📊 **Quick Example**:
```python
# Get real-time stock data
apple_data = await adapter.get_stock_data("AAPL")
print(f"Apple: ${apple_data['current_price']:,.2f}")

# Get crypto prices
btc_data = await adapter.get_crypto_data("bitcoin")
print(f"Bitcoin: ${btc_data['current_price']:,.2f}")

# Get breaking tech news
news = await adapter.get_breaking_news('technology')

# All in one unified interface! 🔥
```

## 🛠️ **Perfect for**:
- AI developers building data-rich applications
- Fintech teams needing market data integrations  
- Researchers requiring multi-source data pipelines
- Anyone learning API integration patterns

## 📚 **Comprehensive Learning Materials**:
✨ Quick start tutorial with live Apple stock data  
🔧 Complete tool overview across all 6 categories  
💰 Advanced financial portfolio analysis  
📊 Multi-source real-time dashboard  

The demo notebooks walk you through everything from basic setup to building sophisticated data applications. All code is production-ready with proper async patterns, caching, and error handling.

## 🌟 **Why MCP?**

Model Context Protocol standardizes how AI applications connect to external data. Instead of building custom integrations for each API, MCP provides a unified interface that works with any compatible AI model or application.

This server demonstrates how to build robust, scalable data integrations that can power everything from investment research platforms to AI training pipelines.
